# Contentful Images API Workbench
A proof-of-concept workbench for exploring various image optimization settings using Contentful's Images API.
These images are already delivered with the [Contentful Image API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/images-api/), so we can easily optimize them to save bandwidth with a few appropriate parameters. Delivered filesizes are shown at the top.

## Future App Ideas
- Integration as a Contentful App? This might be useful in some situations but less so for editors. It might make it easier to select images to test if it's already authenticated.
- Build out with a Contentful content model. This would make it easier to manage metadata, make notes, alt text, copyright, etc. 
- Flexible transformation "recipes" for exploring quality, size, and cropping.

Built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).
